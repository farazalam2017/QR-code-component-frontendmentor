### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h3>Hero of my html page</h3>
```

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
  height: 100vh;
  margin: auto;
}
```

### Continued development

In this project in past few years for the first time i was able to make something using given guide and files without any tutorial help. Just using technique from my past learning. I am not comfortable in positioning elements in my web page however will write all those spells ü™Ñü™Ñü™ÑüîÆ to make my projects in future projects.

## Acknowledgments

First and foremost, I thank Allah, who has blessed me with a good life, wonderful parents, and a supportive environment to learn and grow through all the ups and downs of life.
Remember, all of us are destined to leave this world one day. Before that day comes, strive to do something meaningful ‚Äî something that makes those who remain proud and benefits humanity. Let the tree you plant bear sweet fruits for others, and may you be remembered with a smiling face in the hereafter.
A special thanks to the person who created such a wonderful platform for helping us practice and improve ourselves.
